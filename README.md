*Tech has always been my wakeup call all the time everynow and then.
    - When i was growing up i have always seen people struggle trying to get to health facilities and most of the times even if they went, some would get ome untreated maybe because the doctor they found is not an expert on the sickness the patient had.
    - So i decided i would one day create a system that has doctors of all expertise and also bring in the patients so they would choose their doctor of choice and get the best experience ever.
    - I decided to work on a virtual consultation app that will allow doctors and patients to consult virtually without having to go to the hospitals where they go and queue for hours and maybe also not get treated.
    - The app allows patients to request for appointments from the doctor of their choice and when doctors accept the appointments they set the date and time they want to meeet the patient, the doctor can also reject an appointment and refer the patient to another doctor.

To run the application▶️
   - Git clone
   - Activate the virtual env(source venv/Scripts/activate)
   - cd to the project(bout)
   - Run the virtual enviroment(python manage.py runserver)
   - You'll now be able to use the app.

     *This is how the web app looks like.
   - Here one chooses whether he or she is a Doctor or a Patient.

   - After successful registration if you are a doctor this is how the dashboard looks like, this one is an example of a doctors dashboard.

   - Here is the patients dashboard, the patient can see whether a doctor accepted or they rejected an appointment and the doctor sets the appointment time and date and the patient responds if they'll be available.

   - The web app also has notifications where a doctor is notified if someone requests an appointment and on the patients side they are notified when the doctors sets an appointment and the appointment date. One is also reminded a day before that their appointment is due.
